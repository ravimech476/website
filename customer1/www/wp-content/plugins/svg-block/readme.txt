Display an SVG image as a block, which can be used for displaying images, icons, dividers, buttons

== Description ==

This SVG block allows you to display SVG images as inline HTML markup. You can either choose an icon from the icon library with more than 3000 icons or you can upload or input your custom SVG images directly in the block's setting.
It also allows you to upload SVG images to the WordPress media library, and load them into the icon library. Only SVG files that have XML declaration at the top like `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>` can be uploaded to the WordPress media library.

=== Key Features ===

* Accessibility ready with 'img' role, automatically generates title and description from settings.
* Automatically sanitize SVG markup to make it safe and lightweight.
* Include almost all settings to customize the SVG image.
* Include a collection of common non-rectangular dividers.
* An icon library included icons from "Bootstrap Icons", "Ionicons", "Dashicons" and new "WordPress Icons".
* Allow uploading SVG images to the WordPress media library
* Automatically load SVG images from the media library into the icon library
